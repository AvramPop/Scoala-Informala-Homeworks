// 1. calculate the sum of the first 100 numbers higher than 0

algorithm Sum is:
  s = 100 * 101 / 2
  write s
end_algorithm

//alternative using for loop
algorithm Sum is:
  s = 0
  for i = 1, 100
    s += i
  endfor
  print s
end_algorithm


//2. display the smallest number from a collection of numbers

algorithm Mini is:
  min = collection[0]
  for i = 1, collection.length
    if collection[i] < min
      min = collection[i]
    endif
  endfor
  write min
end_algorithm


//3. display the max digit of a number. Read the number from keyboard

algorithm MaximumDigit is:
  read n, c = -1
  while n > 0
    if n % 10 > c
      c = n % 10
    endif
    n = n / 10
  endwhile
  write c
end_algorithm


//4. check if a number is palindrome

algorithm IsPalindrome is:
  read n
  cn = n
  nrNou = 0
  while n > 0
    nrNou = nrNou * 10 + n % 10
    n = n / 10
  endwhile
  if nrNou == cn
    write cn, "is palindrome"
  else
    write cn, "is not palindrome"
  endif
end_algorithm


//5. display all the prime numbers below a given number

algorithm Primes is:
  read n
  if n < 2
    write "There's no prime number below ", n
  else
    write "2, "
    for i = 3, i < n, i += 2 // iterate with i + 2 because there's no prime even number, another than 2
    ok = 1
      for j = 3, j < i / 2 && ok == 1, j += 2 // check if the number is divisible with an odd number below it's half, otherwise it is prime
        if i % j == 0
          ok = 0 // escape the inner "for" if the number is not prime
        endif
      enfor
      if ok == 1
        write i, ", "
      endif
    endfor
  endif
end_algorithm
